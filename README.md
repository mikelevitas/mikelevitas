Hello! I am a Data Scientist at Roark Capital. I graduated in 2022 with a Master of Science in Business Analytics from the University of Southern California. I received my undergraduate degree in Digital Marketing & International Business from the University of Georgia in 2019, and then I worked for two years as an Analyst for a data transformation company in Atlanta, GA. 

Data analytics and data science are passions of mine, both professionally and as an avid sports fan. My goal is to add value to organizations by delivering actionable insights that cannot be found without in-depth analyses.

Experience with: Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, Jupyter, Matplotlib, seaborn, ggplot), GCP (Google Cloud Platform), Generative AI & LLMs, statistics (predictive modeling, A/B testing, hypothesis testing, significance testing, linear regression, logistic regression, classification, clustering, ANOVA), SQL (BigQuery, PostgreSQL), machine learning (ML), time series (ARIMA, exponential smoothing, PyCaret, linear regression), NLP,  JMP, Tableau, Microsoft Excel, GitHub, Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, Google Workspace, Databricks, and more.
